I highly recommend using Anaconda to manage multiple python versions through _conda_ environments. There are other methods using packages such as [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) but this is my preferred approach.

The tools that we're going to install are by no means the best, ultimately, the best tool is the one you're most comfortable with. We're going to be installing the following technologies:

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
